# Agenda

- Check-in: Any blockers? What don't we understand and why?
- Review Data Clening
- Review EDA [```02_eda.ipynb```](https://github.com/bzekeria/cogs109-final-project/blob/main/notebooks/02_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb)
- Focus on #'s 3-6 from [project guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VCTgKDYME7eK4ETNuDsCDOB6EO2HRAp1OiwYNswPAsc/edit)
  - **3 and 5** 
    - Discuss feature selection + 2nd model
      - Evaluation?
      - Which model is better?
  - **4** Hypothesis
    - H1: The TF-IDF approach will capture important keywords and features that distinguish different product categories
      - **Statistical Test**: Chi-Sqaure- Association between the features and categories
    - H2: Certain categories may have distinct and prominent keywords that contribute more significantly to their classification
      - **Statistical Test**: ANOVA- Compare the means of the TF-IDF score assigned to each feature across the categories
    - H3: The introduction of NLP techniques, such as removing stop words, will improve the classification accuracy
      - We have the raw data so this is merely reading in that file in fitting the TF-IDF vectorization and modeling ya know
      - **Statistical Test**: Paired T-Test- Compare the mean F1-score between the raw data and cleaned data classification results    
    - **Library:** [scipy.stats](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html)
- Paper
  - Go over outline, flow, formatting, citations, footnotes, etc.
  - Visuals + tables configuration
  - Initial read of the paper for the completed sections
  - [LaTex Math Symbols](https://www.cmor-faculty.rice.edu/~heinken/latex/symbols.pdf)
- Anything else?
- Next meeting date?
