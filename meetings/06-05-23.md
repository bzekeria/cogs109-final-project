# Agenda

- Check-in: Any blockers? What don't we understand and why?
- fix eda

## Action Items

| Action Item                  | Assigned To     | Deadline      |
|------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Do statistical test (see below), fix logistic regression write up (include TF-IDF and whatever is needed) + intro |      Neha           |        wednesday 6/7        |
| Do statistical test (see below), do word cloud for all categories, add 1 or 2 to paper, rewrite data cleaning section. talk about those 2 categories under EDA. include other cleaning done under eda as well (u can preface it with we explored the data blah blah and saw there were words less than len(2) which doesn't meet our expectations or we saw words without any vowels which also doesn't meet our expectation [violates grammar rules], etc.) |    Tiffany             |       wednesday 6/7         |
| Do statistical test (see below), fix and organize notebooks (flow, add comments/text if needed, etc.) , add visualziaitons for models (add to paper if we have space)                          |      baraa           |    wednesday 6/7           |

**Hypotheses Statistical Tests**
- H1: The TF-IDF approach will capture important keywords and features that distinguish different product categories
   - Related notebooks: 03
   - **Statistical Test**: Chi-Sqaure- Association between the features and categories
- H2: Certain categories may have distinct and prominent keywords that contribute more significantly to their classification
  - Related notebooks: 01
  - **Statistical Test**: ANOVA/T-test- Compare the means of the TF-IDF score assigned to each feature across the categories
- H3: **Baraa** The introduction of NLP techniques, such as removing stop words, will improve the classification accuracy
  - This meets the comparing two models part from the [project guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VCTgKDYME7eK4ETNuDsCDOB6EO2HRAp1OiwYNswPAsc/edit)
  - We have the raw data so this is merely reading in that file in fitting the TF-IDF vectorization and modeling ya know
  - Related notebooks: all notebooks (excluding data cleaning)
  - **Statistical Test**: Paired T-Test- Compare the mean F1-score between the raw data and cleaned data classification results
