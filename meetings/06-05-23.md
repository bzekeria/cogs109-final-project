## Action Items

| Action Item                  | Assigned To     | Deadline      |
|------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Fix logistic regression write up (include TF-IDF and whatever is needed) + intro |      Neha           |               |
| Do word cloud for all categories, add 1 or 2 to paper, rewrite data cleaning section. talk about those 2 categories under EDA |    Tiffany             |               |
| Do statistical test, fix notebooks, add visualziaiton for models                          |                 |    baraa           |

- H1: The TF-IDF approach will capture important keywords and features that distinguish different product categories
   - Related notebooks: 03
   - **Statistical Test**: Chi-Sqaure- Association between the features and categories
- H2: Certain categories may have distinct and prominent keywords that contribute more significantly to their classification
  - Related notebooks: 01
  - **Statistical Test**: ANOVA/T-test- Compare the means of the TF-IDF score assigned to each feature across the categories
- H3: **Baraa** The introduction of NLP techniques, such as removing stop words, will improve the classification accuracy
  - We have the raw data so this is merely reading in that file in fitting the TF-IDF vectorization and modeling ya know
  - Related notebooks: all notebooks (excluding data cleaning)
  - **Statistical Test**: Paired T-Test- Compare the mean F1-score between the raw data and cleaned data classification results    
- **Library:** [scipy.stats](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html)
