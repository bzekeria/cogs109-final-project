# Agenda

- Discuss project goal. Any blockers? What don't we understand and why?
- Review EDA [```02_eda.ipynb```](https://github.com/bzekeria/cogs109-final-project/blob/main/notebooks/02_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb)
- Focus on #'s 3-6 from [project guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VCTgKDYME7eK4ETNuDsCDOB6EO2HRAp1OiwYNswPAsc/edit)
  - **4** Hypothesis suggestions?
    - H1: The TF-IDF approach will capture important keywords and features that distinguish different product categories
    - H2: Certain categories may have distinct and prominent keywords that contribute more significantly to their classification
    - H3: The introduction of NLP techniques, such as removing stop words, will improve the classification accuracy
      - We have the raw data so this is merely reading in that file in fitting the TF-IDF vectorization and modeling ya know
  - **3 and 5** 
    - Discuss methods + model selection and implementation [```03_feature_eegineering.ipynb```](https://github.com/bzekeria/cogs109-final-project/blob/main/notebooks/03_fetaure_engineering.ipynb)
      - Methods: TF-IDF (derives from BOW) 
      - Models: Multi Naive Bayes Classifier, KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor)
        - Strengths and weaknesses?
          - trade-offs between accuracy, computational complexity, etc.
        - Evaluation?
- Share paper modality suggestion Latex (Overleaf)
  - [Why Latex?](https://towardsdatascience.com/mastering-latex-on-overleaf-71a72d513363)
    - Great for technical papers
    - Consistent automatic formatting (saves us time)
    - Can include visualizations, tables, clickable references, equations, etc.
    - and we all learn something new ðŸ’ª 
  - Review: Intro and Data
  - Fixing: Methods (Feature Extraction)
  - Need to do: Methods (Model Selection), Results (Model Evaluation), etc.
- Anything else?
- Next meeting date?

## Action Items

| Action Item                  | Assigned To     | Deadline      |
|------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Do visuals on EDA, write up data section            |       Tiffany          |               |
| Write up methods + model 1 (MNB)            |        Baraa         |               |
| Write up intro                             |           Neha      |               |
| Look into how/why we shrink the TF-IDF vectorized data +  model 2 **(create seperate jupyter file to show ur code; copy 03 notebook)**                       |   **Everyone**              |               |
